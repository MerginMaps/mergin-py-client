# Changelog

## 0.9.2

- Update rules when pushing with editor permission level (#208)

## 0.9.1

- Support for "editor" permission level for server >= 2024.4.0. Editors have more limited functionality than "writer" permission: they are not allowed to modify the QGIS project file or change structure of tables (#202, #207)
- Better handling of unexpected errors during the initial download of a project (#201)
- Fixes to CI (#205)

## 0.9.0

- Add `reset_local_changes()` API call and `reset` CLI command to make it possible to discard any changes in the local project directory (#107)
- Add `rename_project()` API call and `rename` CLI command to rename a project in its workspace (#190)
- Add `delete_project_now()` API call for immediate project removal (mainly meant for testing)
- Project info can be also queried by project's ID in `MerginClient.project_info()` (#179)
- Improve project metadata handling
  - Add metadata getters in `MerginProject` class: `project_full_name()`, `project_name()`, `workspace_name()`, `project_id()`, `workspace_id()`, `files()`
  - Add metadata setters in `MerginProject` class: `update_metadata()`, `write_metadata()` (should not be needed by module users)
  - Deprecate `MerginProject.metadata` property, replaced by the methods above
  - Store all information from server's project info to `.mergin/mergin.json` instead of just some bits. Keep backwards compatibility to read `mergin.json` if it uses old-style syntax, new pulls/pushes will write new-style syntax (#83, #151)
- Fix awkward way of passing full project names to `create_project()`, `create_project_and_push()`, `clone_project()` and in CLI for `create` command (#180)
- Fix CLI for `list-projects` command (#172)
- Write unhandled Python errors from download/pull/push to the client log (#156)
- Keep client log if download of a project fails for some reason (#155)
